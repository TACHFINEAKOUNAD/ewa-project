            Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by
            severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
            The first case was identified in Wuhan,
            China, in December 2019. The disease has since spread worldwide,
            leading to an ongoing pandemic.
            Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever,
            cough, fatigue,
            breathing difficulties,
            and loss of smell and taste. Symptoms begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus.
            Of those people who develop noticeable symptoms,
            most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia),
            while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia,
            or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging),
            and 5% suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure,
            shock, or multiorgan dysfunction).
            Older people are more likely to have severe symptoms.
            At least a third of the people who are infected with the virus remain asymptomatic
            and do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time,
            but they still can spread the disease. Around 20% of those people will remain asymptomatic throughout infection,
            and the rest will develop symptoms later on,</p>
